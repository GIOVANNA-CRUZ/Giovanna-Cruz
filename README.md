### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1>Work</h1>
  
<p>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the multinational TIVIT
as an intern in the back end area. There I develop all
kinds of programs to train logic, such as: sorting algorithms,
data structure, basic systems and games. I also play with a
little artificial intelligence and cloud computing.</p>

<h1>Study</h1>
<p>- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using the Java programming language
to learn: Data structure, algorithms, OOP, REST API etc. 
I already know how to work with databases (SQL and MYSQL)
and programming languages â€‹â€‹more focused on the front-end
(HTML, CSS and JavaScript). I try to include in my study
routines a little of the infrastructure area that developers
use, such as: HTTP/HTTPS, SSH and servers, such as Proxy, FTP, 
DNS and others.</p>

<h1>Collaborate</h1>
<p>- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in my TCC project, where I'm 
creating a makeup store this year. I used the following technologies:
PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and some frameworks, such as: Bootstrap and 
Jquery. Other than that, I have my personal projects, I'm currently creating
a battleship game.</p>

<h1>Where I look for help</h1>
<p>- ðŸ¤” I look for help with my boss, who is an excellent software architect, 
with my friends from the course and especially in video classes on YouTube,
where I take courses and research about doubts that arise.</p>
