### HI, DEV ðŸ‘‹

<h1>About me</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I'm Giovanna, welcome to my profile!</li>
  <li>I have 18 years</li>
  <li>I work at the Multinacional TIVIT as an intern in the back end area</li>

</ul>

<h1>Work</h1>
  
<p>ðŸ”­ I develop all kinds of programs to train logic, such as:
sorting algorithms, data structure, basic systems and games. 
I also play with a little artificial intelligence and cloud 
computing.</p>

<h1>Study</h1>
<p>- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using the Java programming language
to learn: Data structure, algorithms, OOP, REST API etc. 
I already know how to work with databases (SQL and MYSQL)
and programming languages â€‹â€‹more focused on the front-end
(HTML, CSS and JavaScript). I try to include in my study
routines a little of the infrastructure area that developers
use, such as: HTTP/HTTPS, SSH and servers, such as Proxy, FTP, 
DNS and others.</p>

<h1>Collaborate</h1>
<p>- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in my TCC project, where I'm 
creating a makeup store this year. I used the following technologies:
PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and some frameworks, such as: Bootstrap and 
Jquery. Other than that, I have my personal projects, I'm currently creating
a battleship game.</p>
